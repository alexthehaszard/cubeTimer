# alex's cube timer!

This is just a project I started to because I wanted to make something in p5, but ended up adding a bunch of stuff to it

Currently there is no mobile support for the stats items, because i couldn't find a nice and easy way to fit it into the boxes. I made stackmat support but it kinda broke after a while and I have no idea why, hopefully I'll be able to fix it soon.

I also plan on adding an place for an average function, although i haven't gotten around to that yet.
