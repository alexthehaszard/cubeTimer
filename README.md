# alex's cube timer!

This is just a project I started to because I wanted to make something in p5, but ended up adding a bunch of stuff to it

Currently there is no mobile support for the stats items, because i couldn't find a nice and easy way to fit it into the boxes. Stackmat timers can work by pressing "s" on the keyboard, but it might not work if you don't have a stable connection cause the library i'm using is a bit old.

I also plan on adding an place for an average function, although i haven't gotten around to that yet.
